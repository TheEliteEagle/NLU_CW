# How to run solution 1

The notebook should be entirely setup to run in a Google Colab environment.
The parameters of the notebook are already set to run in inference mode (so shouldn't be an issue generating the test outputs). The interface of the notebook is under the section at the bottom called "Notebook Engine".
For a new dataset, there is a cell at the bottom of the notebook that allows you to add a path to a new csv that can be used to test the model.

Each of the different aspects, e.g. feature vector creation, feature vector components, etc., are under separate headings with in-line comments to describe the functionality.

For the more obscure packages, a pip install command is provided at the top of the notebook before the imports.

Further information can be found in the headings to each section.

# How to run solution 2

The notebooks parameters in the submitted version are already set to run in inference mode (see the flags set under the "Notebook engine" section which controls program control flow).
All flags are set to false, so only function definitions and separate the demo block at the end will run.

Further documentation is provided by comments at the top of the notebook detailing each section, and by comments in the code itself.

# General Information
The large files for the coursework can be found at the following link:
https://livemanchesterac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/benjamin_hatton_student_manchester_ac_uk/Documents/NLU_CW?csf=1&web=1&e=5X0dGK

The files are in the correct directory, such that if the NLU_CW directory was the submission folder, all the pathing would be correct.
