- **Implementation: 45%**
    - Quality of Predictions: 10%
    - Documentation/Organisation: 5%
    - Completeness/Reproducibility: 5%
    - Techincally Sound Code: 10%
    - Creative Approach: 10%
    - Evaluting our implementation: 5%

- **Presentation: 55%**
    - Model Card: 20%
        - Formatting: 5%
        - Informativeness: 10%
        - Accurate Representation: 5%
    - Presentation: 35%

            - Content: 5%
            - Aesthetics: 5%
            - Explanation of poster in demo: 5%
        - Demo session: 20%
            - Code works "out of the box": 10%
            - QA answers: 10%

Only 10% is on the prediction quality, we should focus on the creativeness/code quality and the Presentation, Model Card and Poster.

# To Do List
- [ ] Load dataset (PyTorch) (Ben)
- [ ] Preprocessing (e.g. lemmatisation) (Max)
- [ ] Look into unsupervised learning (hand-written rules) (Ben)
- [ ] Look into DL with Transformers (Max)
