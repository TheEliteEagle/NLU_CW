# How to run solution 2

The notebooks parameters in the submitted version are already set to run in inference mode (see the flags set under the "Notebook engine" section which controls program control flow).
All flags are set to false, so only function definitions and separate the demo block at the end will run.

Further documentation is provided by comments at the top of the notebook detailing each section, and by comments in the code itself.
